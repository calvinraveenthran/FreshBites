# FreshBites Â©
An application for students to order home cooked meals from chefs around town. I used mainly 3 third party extensions which are Parse, PayPal and SWRevealViewController. I want to thank Nayeem Zen (github nayeemzen) & Rajaie Alkorani (github rajaie) for working with me throughout this application. It still needs a few fixes. I am hoping to 

1) Migrate from parse to my own backend server
2) Introduce push notifications 
3) update UI for text insertions
